# Hi, I'm Daven H 👋

I'm a **BSIT student** who's persevering and have a very positive outlook on life, no matter what comes my way.
I’ve learned a few programming languages and database management both in school and through self-study. Some of the languages I’ve worked with include:

- Python
- Java
- HTML, CSS
- PHP
- C++

I’d say I’m at an **intermediate level**—I get the basics and how things function but know there’s still plenty to explore and experience.
Right now, I’m experimenting with different languages and frameworks, figuring out what feels right for me, and working toward becoming a better programmer.

### Hobbies & Interests

When I’m not coding, you can find me:

- Playing chess ♟️
- Hitting the gym 🏋️
- Reading 📚
- Drawing ✏️
- Enjoying music 🎶
